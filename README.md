Title: "Polynomial Regression"
---
#### Assignment Researcher: Arun & Nina


## Structure of the assignment

1.  build dataset
2.  plot them in scatter plot
3.  ensure the data is nonlinear and hence we are moving to polynomial regression.
4.  prepare training and test data set
5.  construct a polynomial regression model and ploy them in a graph using ggplot function
6.  use K- means clustering to spilt the data to find which degree of polynomial suits our regression model.
7.  construct a polynomial regression model.
8.  Test the model with some values and find whether fall in the regression lines.
9.  Conclusion.
