### Introduction {.smaller}

-   Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was discovered in 1956 and has been recognized as one of the most common causes of childhood illness.

-   RSV symptoms usually look like a common cold, but it can be serious leading to bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia, especially for infants and older adults.

-   According to CDC(Center for Disease Control)RSV results in around 58,000 annual hospitalizations and 100 to 300 deaths among children under 5.

#### Situation in USA: {.smaller}

-     In most regions of the United States, RSV circulation starts in the fall and peaks in the winter.

-     With mask-wearing and physical distancing for COVID-19, there were fewer cases of RSV in 2020.

-     RSV cases began to increase in spring 2021 when safety measures relaxed with the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines.

-     This year, RSV in multiple U.S. regions are nearing seasonal peak levels.

#### Researches So Far! {.smaller}

-     Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection trend has gained many researchers' concerns globally. Researchers are using different modeling approaches to predict the RSV trend.

-     Thongpan, Ilada - applied multivariate time-series analysis to show the possible prediction of RSV activity based on the climate in Thailand.

-     Oren, Eyal - tracked RSV through internet search engine data using search filters and domain adaptation techniques to assist in identifying spread of both local and more widespread RSV transmission.

-     Manuel, Britta - applied logistic regression to develop a prediction model and developed a web-based application to predict the individual probability of RSV infection.

-     Reis, Julia - tried to built a real-time RSV prediction system using a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model in conjunction with an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) and 10 years CDC data^\[6\]^

-     Corberán-Vallet : presented Bayesian stochastic susceptible‐infected‐recovered‐susceptible (SIRS) model to understand RSV dynamics in the region of Valencia, Spain.

-     Leecaster, Molly - used simple linear regression to explore the relationship between three epidemic characteristics (final epidemic size, days to peak, and epidemic length)

### Data Collection{.smaller}
-       Data set for this research is from **RSV Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET)** (one of CDC research and surveillance platforms).

-       They conduct population-based surveillance system for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, RSV, and influenza-associated hospitalizations in the US among children younger than 18 years of age and adults.\[8\]

-       RSV-NET has been collecting RSV-associated hospitalizations in adults and children since 2018-2019 season from 58 counties in 12 states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah.

-       Time frame: In season 2018-2019, 2019-2020, data collected is from October 1 to April 30. In season 2020-2021, 2021-2022, 2022-2023, data collected is from October 1 to October 1 next year.

### How an entry is made in data set: {.smaller}

-     A case is defined by laboratory-confirmed RSV in a person who Lives in a defined RSV-NET surveillance area AND Tests positive for RSV within 14 days before or during hospitalization.
