## Introduction {.smaller}

-   Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was discovered in 1956 and has been recognized as one of the most common causes of childhood illness.

-   RSV symptoms usually look like a common cold, but it can be serious leading to bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia, especially for infants and older adults.

-   According to CDC(Center for Disease Control)RSV results in around 58,000 annual hospitalizations and 100 to 300 deaths among children under 5.

-   In most regions of the United States, RSV circulation starts in the fall and peaks in the winter.

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   With mask-wearing and physical distancing for COVID-19, there were fewer cases of RSV in 2020.

-   RSV cases began to increase in spring 2021 when safety measures relaxed with the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines.

-   This year, RSV in multiple U.S. regions are nearing seasonal peak levels.

## Other Research's {.smaller}

-   Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection trend has gained many researchers' concerns globally. Researchers are using different modeling approaches to predict the RSV trend.

-   Thongpan, Ilada: applied multivariate time-series analysis to show the possible prediction of RSV activity based on the climate in Thailand.

-   Manuel, Britta: applied logistic regression to develop a prediction model and developed a web-based application to predict the individual probability of RSV infection.

-   Reis, Julia: tried to built a real-time RSV prediction system using a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model in conjunction with an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) and 10 years CDC data[6]

-   Corberán-Vallet: presented Bayesian stochastic susceptible‐infected‐recovered‐susceptible (SIRS) model to understand RSV dynamics in the region of Valencia, Spain.

-   Leecaster, Molly: used simple linear regression to explore the relationship between three epidemic characteristics (final epidemic size, days to peak, and epidemic length).


## About Data 
::: {.nonincremental} 
A case is defined by laboratory-confirmed RSV in a person who Lives in a defined RSV-NET surveillance area AND Tests positive for RSV withn 14 days before or during hospitalization.

##### Data Collection

-   Data set for this research is from RSV Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET) (one of CDC research and surveillance platforms).

-   They conduct population-based surveillance system for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, RSV, and influenza-associated hospitalizations in the US among children younger than 18 years of age and adults.

-   RSV-NET has been collecting RSV-associated hospitalizations in adults and children since 2018-2019 season from 58 counties in 12 states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah.

-   Time frame: In season 2018-2019, 2019-2020, data collected is from October 1 to April 30. In season 2020-2021, 2021-2022, 2022-2023, data collected is from October 1 to October 1 next year.

##### Initial Observation
-   Data was last updated on 17th November 2022.
-   Oneyear Data: Rate/wk for 52 weeks(YTD)
-   Twoyear Data: Rate/wk for 104 weeks(YTD)

## Why Polynomial Regression

Simple Linear Regression algorithm only works when the relationship between the data is linear, suppose if we have non-linear data then linear regression will not be capable to draw a best-fit line and it fails in such conditions.

#### Non-Linear Data

#### Curvilinear 
Non-linear relationship between dependent and independent variables we add some polynomial terms to linear regression to convert it into Polynomial regression.

#### Polynomial Degree
In statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x.
